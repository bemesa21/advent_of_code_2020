# Advent of Code 2020 solutions

These are my solutions for the AoC 2020 exercises using Elixir ðŸ‘Œ
I used the elixir [starter template](https://github.com/mhanberg/advent-of-code-elixir-starter) to organize the code 

## Usage

There are 25 modules, 25 tests, and 50 mix tasks.

You can see my solutions by running mix d0[n].p[m]

- n is the exercise number and
- m is the part (1 or 2)
